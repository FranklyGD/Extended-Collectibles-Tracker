# Extended Collectibles Tracker

Where the remaining stuff at?

---

This mod allows you to locate any of the collectibles and display their current state of unlocked or not. Pearls are also included being tracked since their progress of being read are also persistent within the save.

Map shows locations of them when viewed. Exact locations if the area is explored, otherwise a faint glowing aura is shown over the room.

Sleep screen also has the status of pearls appended under the unlocks for each respective column. An additional status can be interpreted here if you have pearls with you in shelter, via color pulsation.
